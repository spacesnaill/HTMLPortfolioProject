      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Ever since I was young I've had a passion for software. The concept of being able to create a whole new world with nothing but 1's and 0's, or being able to automate tasks with lightning fast speeds has always amazed me. I knew I wanted to work with Software, and I knew in High School that I wanted to persue a Computer Science Degree. I count myself lucky, as a lot of people who enter college have no idea what they want to Major in, and others hop around different Majors until they find what is perfect for them. I was a Computer Science Major as soon as I entered Frostburg State University as a Freshman, and after that I never swayed from my conviction until I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science in May, 2017. Throughout that process I learned much, and some languages that I've enjoyed working with are Java, C# in the form in the Unity Game Engine, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I still have much to learn when it comes to both Software Engineering and Programming, and while this may be daunting to some I find the everchanging, everevolving aspect of this field to be its greatest strength. There's always something new and useful learn, and I'm excited to delve into every new technology.
